CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view published venue images" ON venue_images FOR SELECT USING (is_published = true);
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all venue images" ON venue_images FOR ALL USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));

-- Gallery Photos (controlled publishing)
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view published gallery photos" ON gallery_photos FOR SELECT USING (is_published = true);
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all gallery photos" ON gallery_photos FOR ALL USING (has_role(auth.uid(), 'admin'::app_role));
```

### Storage Bucket Policies

    table: 'venue_images'
  }, () => {
    fetchImages(); // Refresh UI instantly
  })

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Images Not Loading**
- Check bucket public URL configuration
- Verify RLS policies allow access
- Ensure correct MIME types in database

**2. Real-time Not Working**
- Confirm `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is set
- Check realtime publication includes table
- Verify subscription channel is active

**3. Navigation Horizontal Scroll**
- Apply `overflow-x: hidden` to html/body
- Check navigation container max-width
- Ensure touch targets don't exceed viewport

**4. Upload Failures**
- Verify bucket exists and is public
- Check file size limits (5MB max)
- Ensure user has admin role permissions

### Database Queries for Debugging
```sql
-- Check venue images
SELECT vi.*, v.name as venue_name 
FROM venue_images vi 
JOIN venues v ON vi.venue_id = v.id 
ORDER BY vi.created_at DESC;

-- Verify RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check realtime subscriptions
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```
